# GoodSkin Wellness App

## Overview :
This project aims to develop an Android app for customized skincare, prioritizing a user- friendly interface that caters to skincare enthusiasts. This app will not only design a skincare routine based on the skin concern of the user, but also provide the active ingredients to be used for solving the problem and give product recommendations based on their particular skin type and skin concerns.

## Project Demonstration :

First, the user will be introduced to the home page of the application, where they will be asked to further enter the app.

![Home_Page](https://github.com/niharikaaa21/GoodSkin-Wellness-App/assets/102322171/16346f37-5fd9-4d7d-b21a-ac88adeed4f8)


Next, the user will be directed to a page where they will have to choose their skin types between 4 options given - Normal, Dry, Oily and Combination. They also have an option of returning to home page if they want.

Based on the skin type chosen by the user, the application will display a routine for that particular skin type, which will include both the AM (daytime) and PM (nighttime) skin care routine. These routines will detail what products to use and in what order, namely - a cleanser, serum, moisturizer, sunscreen, and a night cream. This routine also includes product recommendations for each category according to the skin type chosen by the user.

Now, the user can futher choose to go to either selecting a skin concern (which will help in the recommendation of a serum), or choose to view the basic routine for another skin type. There are four skin concerns that are currently available - hyperpigmentation, acne, dry skin and textured skin.

According to the option selected by the user, information on that particular skin concern will be displyed on the next page. This will outline the active ingredients that should be integrated in the user's skincare regimen, while also providing a serum product recommendation that includes the same. This can be incorporated into the basic skincare routine of the user provided earlier, leading to a customised skincare, catered specifically towards the user's skin type and concern.

## Technologies Used For Development :

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro) :

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android app development. Developed by JetBrains in collaboration with Google, Android Studio is specifically designed to streamline the process of creating Android applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for developers, including a code editor, debugger, and emulator, to facilitate efficient and effective development. Android Studio supports the use of Java, Kotlin, and C++ programming languages for app development.

- [Java in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/build/jdks) :

- [XML in Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Xml):

XML (extensible Markup Language) is a key component in Android Studio used for defining the layout and design of user interfaces in Android applications. In Android development, XML is primarily employed in conjunction with Java or Kotlin to create a separation between the application's logic and its presentation layer.

In Android Studio, XML is used to describe the arrangement and appearance of UI elements such as buttons, text views, and layouts. The XML files, often referred to as layout files, define the structure and attributes of these elements, allowing developers to specify how the user interface should look and behave.
